# Web View of the Linear Graph Plotter

I made this a simple web-based tool that allows you to plot the graph of a linear equation in the form of `y = mx + c`. You can input values for the gradient (`m`) and the y-intercept (`c`) to visualize the graph of the equation. My own is that if you're not satisfied with the interface, you should design yours godamnit! (and create a pull request. I'd accept it.)

## How to Use this tool

1. Open a web browser and access the tool through a web server with PHP support.

2. You will see a web page with a form that allows you to enter the values for `m` and `c`.

3. Enter numeric values for the gradient (`m`) and the y-intercept (`c`).

4. Click the "Plot Graph" button to submit the form.

5. The tool will calculate and display the graph of the linear equation `y = mx + c` based on the provided values.

## For Instance

Here's an example of how to use the tool:

- Enter `m` (Gradient): 2
- Enter `c` (Y-Intercept): 1
- Click **"Plot Graph."**

This will plot the graph of the equation `y = 2x + 1`.

## Basic Features

- Simple and user-friendly web interface.
- Instant graph plotting based on the provided values.
- Error handling for non-numeric inputs.

```I would appreciate more features added to it```
