This is a simple program that plots a graph of a straight line using the gradient (m) and y-intercept (c) in both C++ and PHP.

## Instructions

### C++

1. Compile the C++ code using your preferred compiler.
2. Run the compiled program.
3. Enter the gradient (m) and y-intercept (c) when prompted.
4. The program will display the graph on the console.

### PHP

1. Run the PHP script in your PHP environment.

## For Instance

Here's an example of how to use the program:

**Enter the gradient (m): 2**
**Enter the y-intercept (c): 3**

This will plot the graph of the line `y = 2x + 3`.
